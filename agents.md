# Mira Studio — Agent Context

> Standing context for any agent entering this repo. Not sprint-specific.

---

## Product Summary

Mira is a Vercel-hosted Studio UI for managing ideas from capture through execution. Ideas arrive from a custom GPT via webhook (or locally via a dev harness), then flow through a clarification tunnel (Drill), become projects, get reviewed via PR previews, and are ultimately shipped or archived.

**Core user journey:** Capture → Clarify → Build → Review → Ship/Archive

**Local development model:** The user is the local dev. They brainstorm ideas locally in the app and test the full flow. The API endpoints are the same contract that a custom GPT will hit in production. In local mode, ideas are entered via a `/dev/gpt-send` harness page. PRs and previews are simulated with local records.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm run dev          # start dev server (next dev)
npm run build        # production build (next build)
npm run lint         # eslint
npx tsc --noEmit     # type check
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Data persistence is JSON-file based
All services read/write through `lib/storage.ts` to `.local-data/studio.json`. Data survives server restarts. If the file doesn't exist, it auto-seeds from `lib/seed-data.ts`. **Do not** import mock arrays directly — always go through service functions.

### Drill page is a client component
`app/drill/page.tsx` is `'use client'`. It must use `fetch()` to call API routes. It cannot import server-side services directly.

### All data mutations must go through API routes
Client components call `/api/*` endpoints. Server components can import services directly. This ensures the same contract works for both the UI and the future custom GPT.

### Review merge button must call the API
The "Merge PR" button in `review/[prId]/page.tsx` must POST to `/api/actions/merge-pr`. Never mutate state directly from the component.

### GitHub adapter is a real Octokit client
`lib/adapters/github-adapter.ts` is a full provider boundary using `@octokit/rest`. All GitHub operations go through this adapter — never call Octokit directly from routes. The adapter reads credentials from `lib/config/github.ts` via `lib/github/client.ts`. If GitHub is not configured (no token), the app degrades gracefully to local-only mode.

### GitHub webhook route verifies signatures
The GitHub webhook (`app/api/webhook/github/route.ts`) uses HMAC-SHA256 to verify payloads. Requires `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`. Events are dispatched to per-event handlers in `lib/github/handlers/`.

### Vercel webhook is still a stub
Only the Vercel webhook handler remains a stub. GPT and GitHub webhooks are functional.

### `studio-copy.ts` is the single source for UI labels
All user-facing text should come from this file. Some pages still hardcode strings — fix them when you see them.

### Route naming vs. internal naming
Code uses "arena" / "icebox" / "killed" / "shipped" internally. The UI should present these in friendlier terms: "In Progress" / "On Hold" / "Removed" / "Shipped".

## SOPs

### SOP-1: Always use `lib/routes.ts` for navigation
**Learned from**: Initial scaffolding

- ❌ `href="/arena"` (hardcoded)
- ✅ `href={ROUTES.arena}` (centralized)

### SOP-2: All UI copy goes through `lib/studio-copy.ts`
**Learned from**: Sprint 1 UX audit

- ❌ `<h1>Trophy Room</h1>` (inline string)
- ✅ `<h1>{COPY.shipped.heading}</h1>` (centralized copy)

### SOP-3: State transitions go through `lib/state-machine.ts`
**Learned from**: Initial architecture

- ❌ Manually setting `idea.status = 'arena'` in a page
- ✅ Use `getNextIdeaState(idea.status, 'commit_to_arena')` to validate transition

### SOP-4: Never push/pull from git
**Learned from**: Multi-agent coordination

- ❌ `git push`, `git pull`, `git merge`
- ✅ Only modify files. Coordinator handles version control.

### SOP-5: All data mutations go through API routes
**Learned from**: GPT contract compatibility

- ❌ Calling `updateIdeaStatus()` directly from a client component
- ✅ `fetch('/api/actions/kill-idea', { method: 'POST', body: ... })`
- Why: The custom GPT will hit the same `/api/*` endpoints. The UI must exercise the same contract.

### SOP-6: Use `lib/storage.ts` for all persistence
**Learned from**: In-memory data loss on server restart

- ❌ `const ideas: Idea[] = [...MOCK_IDEAS]` (module-level array, lost on restart)
- ✅ `const ideas = storage.read('ideas')` (reads from `.local-data/studio.json`)
- Why: Local data must survive server restarts. JSON file storage is the local persistence layer.

### SOP-7: GitHub operations go through the adapter, never raw Octokit
**Learned from**: Sprint 2 architecture

- ❌ `const octokit = new Octokit(...)` in a route handler
- ✅ `import { createIssue } from '@/lib/adapters/github-adapter'`
- Why: The adapter is the auth boundary. When migrating from PAT to GitHub App, only `lib/github/client.ts` changes. Business logic stays untouched.

### SOP-8: Don't call the adapter from routes — use services
**Learned from**: Sprint 2 architecture

- ❌ `import { createIssue } from '@/lib/adapters/github-adapter'` in a route
- ✅ `import { createIssueFromProject } from '@/lib/services/github-factory-service'`
- Why: Services orchestrate: load local data → call adapter → update local records → create inbox events. Routes stay thin.
