# Mira Studio — Product Roadmap

> Living document. The vision is large; the sprints are small.

---

## Core Thesis

**Mira is a system that generates temporary realities for the user to live inside.**

The user talks to a Custom GPT. The GPT proposes *Experiences* — structured, typed modules that the user lives through inside the app. A coding agent *realizes* those experiences against typed schemas and pushes them through a review pipeline. Supabase is the canonical runtime memory. GitHub is the realization substrate. The frontend renders experiences from schema, not from hardcoded pages.

The central noun is **Experience**, not PR, not Issue, not Project.

Sometimes the system explains why it's creating an experience. Sometimes it just drops you in. The **resolution object** controls which.

---

## The Paradigm Shift: Multi-Agent Experience Engine

Mira is actively moving away from the saturated "AI Chatbot" space (which suffers from "chat contamination") and into a **Multi-Agent Experience Engine**. It acts as an orchestrator: taking messy human intent (via Custom GPT), mapping it into a durable structured workspace (the App + Supabase), and tagging in heavy-lifters (the Genkit internal intelligence layer or GitHub SWE Coder) when complexity exceeds text generation.

### High-Impact Modes
1. **The "Zero-to-One" Project Incubator**: Takes a messy brain-dump, scaffolds a structured multi-phase experience, and escalates to a SWE agent to build live infrastructure (e.g., scaffolding a Next.js landing page).
2. **Adaptive Deep-Learning**: Multi-pass construction of daily educational modules (Education, Challenge, Reflection) with hybrid escalation (e.g., inline live tutoring inside a broken repo).
3. **Cognitive & Executive Scaffolding**: Avoids heavy task lists for overwhelmed users. Heavy reliance on ephemeral experiences, synthesis snapshots, and proactive low-friction state reconstruction.

## Where We Are Today

### ✅ Sprint 1 — Local Control Plane (Complete)

Idea capture, 6-step drill, promote/ship lifecycle, JSON file persistence via `lib/storage.ts` → `.local-data/studio.json`, inbox events, dev harness.

### ✅ Sprint 2 — GitHub Factory (Complete, Lane 6 integration pending)

Real Octokit adapter (`lib/adapters/github-adapter.ts`), signature-verified webhook pipeline (`lib/github/`), issue creation, PR creation, coding agent assignment (Copilot), workflow dispatch, factory/sync services, action upgrades with GitHub-aware state machine. Lanes 1–5 all TSC-clean. Lane 6 (integration proof) still open.

### ✅ Sprint 3 — Foundation Pivot: DB + Experience Types (Complete)

Supabase is live (project `bbdhhlungcjqzghwovsx`). 16 Mira-specific tables deployed. Storage adapter pattern in place (`lib/storage-adapter.ts`) with JSON fallback. Experience type system (`types/experience.ts`, `types/interaction.ts`, `types/synthesis.ts`), experience state machine, services (experience, interaction, synthesis), and all API routes operational. GPT re-entry endpoint (`/api/gpt/state`) returns compressed state packets. 6 Tier 1 templates seeded. Dev user seeded. All verification criteria pass.

### ✅ Sprint 4 — Experience Renderer + Library (Complete)

Renderer registry (`lib/experience/renderer-registry.tsx`), workspace page (`/workspace/[instanceId]`), library page (`/library`), experience cards, step renderers (Questionnaire, Lesson, Challenge, Plan Builder, Reflection, Essay+Tasks), interaction recording via `useInteractionCapture` hook, resolution-driven chrome levels, re-entry engine, persistent experience lifecycle (proposed → active → completed), and home page surfaces for active/proposed experiences. All verification criteria pass.

### ✅ Sprint 5B — Experience Workspace Hardening (Complete)

Field-tested the 18-step "AI Operator Brand" experience and exposed 10 hard failures (R1–R10). Built contracts (Gate 0), experience graph, timeline, profile, validators, and progression engine across 6 parallel lanes.

### ✅ Sprint 6 — Experience Workspace: Navigation, Drafts, Renderers, Steps API, Scheduling (Complete)

Transformed experiences from linear form-wizards into navigable workspaces. R1–R10 upgrades shipped:
- **R1** Non-linear step navigation — sidebar (heavy), top bar (medium), hidden (light)
- **R2** Checkpoint text input — lessons with writing prompts now render textareas
- **R3** Essay writing surface — per-task textareas with word counts
- **R4** Expandable challenge workspaces — objectives expand into mini-workspaces
- **R5** Plan builder notes — items expand to show detail areas
- **R6** Multi-pass enrichment — step CRUD, reorder, insert APIs for GPT to update steps after creation
- **R9** Experience overview dashboard — visual grid of all steps with progress stats
- **R10** Draft persistence — auto-save to artifacts table, hydration on revisit, "Last saved" indicator
- **Migration 004** — step status, scheduled_date, due_date, estimated_minutes, completed_at on experience_steps
- **OpenAPI schema updated** — 5 new endpoints: step CRUD, reorder, progress, drafts

### ✅ Sprint 7 — Genkit Intelligence Layer (Complete)

Replaced naive string summaries and keyword-splitting with AI-powered intelligence via Genkit + Gemini 2.5 Flash:
- **Intelligent Synthesis** — `synthesizeExperienceFlow` extracts narrative summary, behavioral signals, friction assessment, and next candidates from experience interactions
- **Smart Facet Extraction** — `extractFacetsFlow` semantically identifies interests, skills, goals, preferred modes, depth preferences, and friction patterns with confidence scores and evidence strings
- **Context-Aware Suggestions** — `suggestNextExperienceFlow` produces personalized next-experience recommendations based on user profile, completion history, and friction level
- **GPT State Compression** — `compressGPTStateFlow` condenses the raw GPT state packet into a token-efficient narrative with priority signals and a suggested opening topic
- **Completion Wiring** — `completeExperienceWithAI()` orchestrates synthesis + facet extraction + friction update on every experience completion
- **Graceful Degradation** — `runFlowSafe()` wrapper ensures all AI flows fall back to existing mechanical behavior when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unavailable
- **Migration 005** — `evidence` column added to `profile_facets` for AI-generated extraction justification

### 🔄 Current Phase — Intelligent Experience Engine Live

The GPT Custom instructions and OpenAPI schema are defined in `openschema.md` / `public/openapi.yaml`. The app runs on `localhost:3000` with a Cloudflare tunnel at `https://mira.mytsapi.us`. The GPT can:
- Fetch user state (`getGPTState`) — **now includes AI-compressed narrative + priority signals**
- Create ephemeral experiences (`injectEphemeral`) — including 20-question intake pages
- Propose persistent experiences (`createPersistentExperience`) — including 18-step multi-day curricula
- Capture raw ideas (`captureIdea`)
- List existing experiences (`listExperiences`)
- Update individual steps (`updateExperienceStep`) — multi-pass enrichment
- Add/remove/reorder steps (`addExperienceStep`, `deleteExperienceStep`, `reorderExperienceSteps`)
- Check progress (`getExperienceProgress`)
- Read/write drafts (`getDraft`, `saveDraft`)
- **NEW:** Get AI-enriched next-experience suggestions (`getSuggestions`)

**What works:** GPT → create experience → user navigates freely in workspace → drafts persist across sessions → interactions recorded → GPT re-enters with AI-compressed state. Experience completion triggers: AI synthesis → semantic facet extraction → context-aware suggestions. Full lifecycle for both ephemeral and persistent experiences. The system degrades gracefully without API key.

**What's next:** Sprint 8 — Proposal/Realization/Coder Pipeline. Wire the approval flow to trigger realization via GitHub SWE agent. Or: Sprint 8 — Coaching Layer. Build `coachChatFlow` for in-app, context-aware step-level feedback during experience navigation.

### Two Parallel Truths

| Layer | Source of Truth | What It Stores |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Runtime truth** | Supabase | What the user saw, clicked, answered, completed, skipped. Experience state, interaction events, artifacts produced, synthesis snapshots, profile facets. |
| **Realization truth** | GitHub | What the coder built or changed. Issues, PRs, workflow runs, check results, release history. |

The app reads runtime state from Supabase and realization state from GitHub. Neither replaces the other.

---

## Key Concepts

### The Resolution Object

Every experience carries a resolution that makes it intentional rather than arbitrary.

```ts
resolution = {
  depth:      'light' | 'medium' | 'heavy'
  mode:       'illuminate' | 'practice' | 'challenge' | 'build' | 'reflect'
  timeScope:  'immediate' | 'session' | 'multi_day' | 'ongoing'
  intensity:  'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
}
```

The resolution controls:
- What the renderer shows (light = minimal chrome, heavy = full scaffolding)
- How the coder authors the experience (depth + mode = spec shape)
- Whether GPT explains why or just drops you in (light+immediate = immerse, heavy+ongoing = explain)
- How chaining works (light chains to light, heavy chains to progression)

Stored on `experience_instances.resolution` (JSONB).

### GPT Entry Modes

Controlled by resolution, not hardcoded:

| Resolution Profile | GPT Behavior | User Experience |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `depth: light`, `timeScope: immediate` | Drops you in, no explanation | World you step into |
| `depth: medium`, `timeScope: session` | Brief framing, then in | Teacher with context |
| `depth: heavy`, `timeScope: multi_day` | Full rationale + preview | Guided curriculum |

This is NOT a boolean. It's a spectrum driven by the resolution object.

### Persistent vs. Ephemeral Experiences

| Dimension | Persistent | Ephemeral |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Pipeline | Proposal → Realization → Review → Publish | GPT creates directly via endpoint |
| Storage | Full instance + steps + events | Instance record + events (lightweight) |
| Review | Required before going live | Skipped — instant render |
| Lifespan | Long-lived, revisitable | Momentary, archivable |
| Examples | Course, plan builder, research sprint | "Write 3 hooks now", "React to this trend", "Try this one thing today" |

Ephemeral experiences add **soft spontaneity** — interruptions, nudges, micro-challenges that make the system feel alive rather than pipeline-like.

```ts
experience_instances.instance_type = 'persistent' | 'ephemeral'
```

Rules:
- Ephemeral skips the realization pipeline entirely
- GPT can create ephemeral experiences directly via endpoint
- Frontend renders them instantly
- Still logs interaction events (telemetry is never skipped)
- Can be upgraded to persistent if the user wants to return

### The Re-Entry Contract

Every experience defines how it creates its own continuation.

```ts
reentry = {
  trigger:      'time' | 'completion' | 'inactivity' | 'manual'
  prompt:       string   // what GPT should say/propose next
  contextScope: 'minimal' | 'full' | 'focused'
}
```

Stored on `experience_instances.reentry` (JSONB).

Examples:
- After a challenge: `{ trigger: "completion", prompt: "reflect on what surprised you", contextScope: "focused" }`
- After a plan builder: `{ trigger: "time", prompt: "check in on milestone progress in 3 days", contextScope: "full" }`
- After an ephemeral: `{ trigger: "manual", prompt: "want to go deeper on this?", contextScope: "minimal" }`

Without re-entry contracts, GPT re-entry is generic. With them, every experience creates its own continuation thread.

### Experience Graph

Lightweight linking — no graph DB needed. Just two fields on `experience_instances`:

```ts
previous_experience_id:   string | null
next_suggested_ids:       string[]
```

This unlocks:
- **Chaining:** Questionnaire → Plan Builder → Challenge
- **Loops:** Weekly reflection → same template, new instance
- **Branching:** "You could do A or B next"
- **Backtracking:** "Return to where you left off"

## Entity Model

### Core Experience Entities

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `experience_templates` | Reusable shapes the system can render | `id`, `slug`, `name`, `class`, `renderer_type`, `schema_version`, `config_schema`, `status` |
| `experience_instances` | Actual generated experience for a user | `id`, `user_id`, `idea_id`, `template_id`, `title`, `goal`, `instance_type` (persistent/ephemeral), `status`, `resolution` (JSONB), `reentry` (JSONB), `previous_experience_id`, `next_suggested_ids` (JSONB), `friction_level`, `source_conversation_id`, `generated_by`, `realization_id`, `created_at`, `published_at` |
| `experience_steps` | What the user sees/does within an experience | `id`, `instance_id`, `step_order`, `step_type`, `title`, `payload` (JSONB), `completion_rule` |
| `interaction_events` | Raw telemetry — no interpretation | `id`, `instance_id`, `step_id`, `event_type`, `event_payload` (JSONB), `created_at` |
| `artifacts` | Anything the user produces during an experience | `id`, `instance_id`, `artifact_type`, `title`, `content`, `metadata` (JSONB) |
| `synthesis_snapshots` | Compressed packets for GPT re-entry | `id`, `user_id`, `source_type`, `source_id`, `summary`, `key_signals` (JSONB), `next_candidates` (JSONB), `created_at` |
| `profile_facets` | Structured long-lived user direction | `id`, `user_id`, `facet_type`, `value`, `confidence`, `source_snapshot_id`, `updated_at` |

### Preserved Entities (migrated from JSON → Supabase)

| Entity | Current Location | Migration |
|--------|-----------------|-----------| 
| `ideas` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Move to Supabase `ideas` table |
| `projects` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Evolve into `realizations` table |
| `tasks` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Fold into `experience_steps` or keep as `realization_tasks` |
| `prs` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Evolve into `realization_reviews` table |
| `inbox` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Evolve into `timeline_events` table |
| `drill_sessions` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Move to Supabase `drill_sessions` table |
| `agent_runs` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Move to Supabase `agent_runs` table |
| `external_refs` | `.local-data/studio.json` | Move to Supabase `external_refs` table |

### New Supporting Entities

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `users` | Single-user now, multi-user ready. Profile anchor. |
| `conversations` | GPT conversation sessions with metadata |
| `realizations` | Internal realization object replacing "project" in code-execution contexts. Not "build" — because we're realizing experiences, not building features. |
| `realization_reviews` | Approval surface. User sees "Approve Experience" — maps internally to PR/realization review. |

### Friction Signal

A computed field on `experience_instances` — **recorded during synthesis only, never interpreted in-app**:

```ts
friction_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | null
```

Computed from interaction events:
- High skip rate → high friction
- Long dwell + completion → low friction
- Abandonment mid-step → medium/high friction

The app does NOT act on this. GPT reads it during re-entry and adjusts future proposals accordingly.

## Experience Classes

### Tier 1 — Ship First

| Class | Renderer | User Sees |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Questionnaire** | Multi-step form with branching | Questions → answers → summary |
| **Lesson** | Scrollable content with checkpoints | Sections → reading → knowledge checks |
| **Challenge** | Task list with completion tracking | Objectives → actions → proof |
| **Plan Builder** | Editable structured document | Goals → milestones → resources → timeline |
| **Reflection Check-in** | Prompt → free response → synthesis | Prompts → writing → GPT summary |
| **Essay + Tasks** | Long-form content with embedded tasks | Reading → doing → artifacts |

### Tier 2 — Ship Next

| Class | Example Mapping |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Trend Injection** | "Here's what's happening in X — react" |
| **Research Sprint** | Curated sources → analysis → brief |
| **Social Practice** | Scenarios → responses → feedback |
| **Networking Adventure** | Outreach targets → scripts → tracking |
| **Content Week Planner** | Topics → calendar → production tasks |

### How Ideas Map to Experience Chains

| Idea | Experience Chain | Resolution Profile |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Make better videos" | Lesson → Content Week Planner → Challenge | `medium / practice / multi_day / medium` |
| "Start a company" | Questionnaire → Plan Builder → Research Sprint | `heavy / build / ongoing / high` |
| "Better social life" | Reflection Check-in → Social Practice → Adventure | `medium / practice / multi_day / medium` |
| "Get a better job" | Questionnaire → Plan Builder → Networking Adventure | `heavy / build / multi_day / high` |
| "Learn options trading" | Lesson → Challenge → Reflection Check-in | `medium / illuminate / session / medium` |
| *GPT micro-nudge* | Ephemeral Challenge | `light / challenge / immediate / low` |
| *Trend alert* | Ephemeral Trend Injection | `light / illuminate / immediate / low` |

## Experience Lifecycle

### Persistent Experiences (full pipeline)

```
Phase A: Conversation
  User talks to GPT → GPT fetches state → GPT proposes experience

Phase B: Proposal
  GPT emits typed proposal via endpoint:
    { experienceType, goal, resolution, reentry, sections, taskCount, whyNow }
  → Saved as proposed experience in Supabase (instance_type = 'persistent')

Phase C: Realization
  Coder receives proposal + repo context
  → Creates/instantiates template + frontend rendering
  → Pushes through GitHub if needed (PR, workflow)
  → Creates realization record linking experience to GitHub PR

Phase D: Review
  User sees: Draft → Ready for Review → Approved → Published
  Buttons: Preview Experience · Approve · Request Changes · Publish
  Internal mapping: Draft→PR open, Approve→approval flag, Publish→merge+activate

Phase E: Runtime
  User lives the experience in /workspace
  App records: what shown, clicked, answered, completed, skipped
  → interaction_events + artifacts in Supabase

Phase F: Re-entry
  Re-entry contract fires (on completion, time, inactivity, or manual)
  Next GPT session fetches compressed packet from /api/synthesis:
    latest experiences, outcomes, artifacts, friction signals, re-entry prompts
  → GPT resumes with targeted awareness, not generic memory
```

### Ephemeral Experiences (instant pipeline)

```
GPT calls /api/experiences/inject
  → Creates experience_instance (instance_type = 'ephemeral')
  → Skips realization pipeline entirely
  → Frontend renders instantly
  → Still logs interaction events
  → Re-entry contract can escalate to persistent if user engages deeply
```

---

## User-Facing Approval Language

| Internal State | User Sees | Button |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| PR open / draft | Drafted | — |
| PR ready | Ready for Review | Preview Experience |
| PR approved | Approved | Publish |
| PR merged + experience activated | Published | — |
| New version supersedes | Superseded | — |
| Changes requested | Needs Changes | Request Changes / Reopen |

---

## Frontend Surface Map

| Surface | Route | Purpose | Status |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Workspace** | `/workspace/[instanceId]` | Lived experience surface. Renders typed modules. Handles both persistent and ephemeral. | 🔲 New |
| **Library** | `/library` | All experiences: active, completed, paused, suggested, ephemeral history | 🔲 New |
| **Timeline** | `/timeline` | Chronological feed: proposals, realizations, completions, ephemerals, suggestions | 🔲 New (evolves from `/inbox`) |
| **Profile** | `/profile` | Compiled direction view: goals, interests, efforts, patterns | 🔲 New |
| **Review** | `/review/[id]` | Approve/publish experiences (internally maps to PR/realization review) | ✅ Exists, needs language refactor |
| **Send** | `/send` | Idea capture from GPT | ✅ Preserved |
| **Drill** | `/drill` | 6-step idea clarification | ✅ Preserved |
| **Arena** | `/arena` | Active work surface (evolves to show active realizations + experiences) | ✅ Preserved, evolves |
| **Icebox** | `/icebox` | Deferred ideas + experiences | ✅ Preserved |
| **Archive** | `/shipped`, `/killed` | Completed / removed | ✅ Preserved |

---

## Coder-Context Strategy (Deferred — Sprint 8+)

> Directionally correct but not critical path. The experience system, renderer, DB, and re-entry are the priority. Coder intelligence evolves later once there's runtime data to compile from.

Generated markdown summaries derived from DB — not hand-maintained prose:

| File | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `docs/coder-context/user-profile.md` | `profile_facets` + `synthesis_snapshots` | Who is this user |
| `docs/coder-context/current-goals.md` | Active `experience_instances` + `profile_facets` | What's in flight |
| `docs/coder-context/capability-map.md` | Renderer registry + endpoint contracts | What the system can do |

These are a nice-to-have once the experience loop is running. Do not over-invest here in early sprints.

---

## GitHub Usage Rules

### Use GitHub For
- Implementation work (PRs, branches)
- Workflow runs (Actions)
- Realization validation (checks)
- PR review (approval gate)
- Release history
- Durable realization automation

### Use Issues Only When
- Realization is large and needs decomposition
- Agent assignment / tracking is needed
- Cross-session execution visibility required

### Do NOT Use Issues For
- Every questionnaire or user answer
- Every experience runtime event
- Every content module instance
- Ephemeral experiences (they never touch GitHub)

**Rule: DB for runtime · GitHub for realization lifecycle · Studio UI for human-facing continuity.**

---

## Strategic UX & Utility Upgrades (The "Glass Box")
To make the orchestration transparent and powerful, these UX paradigms guide future development:

1. **The Spatial "Split-Brain" Interface**: A dual-pane UI where the left pane is the "Stream" (ephemeral chat) and the right pane is the "Scaffold" (the durable Workspace). Users watch the GPT extract goals and snap them into beautifully rendered Modules in real-time.
2. **Visualizing the "Multi-Pass" Engine**: Do not hide generation behind spinners. Expose stages dynamically: _"Inferring constraints..."_ → _"Scaffolding timeline..."_ → _"Injecting challenges..."_
3. **The "Glass Box" Profile Surfacing**: An "Inferred Profile" dashboard showing exactly what the system thinks the user's constraints, means, and skill levels are, tightly coupled to the `profile_facets` table. Manual overrides instantly re-align GPT strategy.
4. **Coder Escalation as a Hero Moment**: When the SWE agent is invoked, the UI dims and a "Realization Work" widget appears in plain-English showing real-time GitHub Actions infrastructure being built.
5. **Hidden Scratchpad Actions**: The GPT quietly upserts user insights into Supabase before generating modules, preventing prompt context overload.
6. **Micro-Regeneration**: Ability to highlight a specific module inside an App Workspace and click **"Tune."** Opens a micro-chat only for that module to break it down further.
7. **"Interrupt & Re-Route" Safety Valve**: An unstructured brain-dump button when life derails a plan. The GPT dynamically rewrites remaining runtime state to adapt without inducing failure states.
8. **Escalation Ledger to Template Factory**: Strip PII from highly-used SWE Coder escalations (e.g. "build calendar sync") and turn them into reusable "Starter Kit Modules".

---

### ✅ Sprint 5 — Data-First Experience Testing (Complete)

> **Goal:** Prove the GPT-created experience loop works. The system must create durable, stateful, action-producing experiences that feel meaningfully better than plain chat.

> **Result:** Structure ✅ State ✅ Behavior ✅ — but field-testing exposed 10 hard renderer failures (Sprint 5B). The GPT authored an excellent 18-step curriculum; the renderers couldn't support it. Led directly to Sprint 6 workspace upgrades.

#### Phase 5A — GPT Connection

| # | Work Item | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Custom GPT instructions | Written. See `openschema.md` Part 1. Defines Mira's personality, the 6 experience types, step payload formats, re-entry behavior, resolution semantics. |
| 2 | OpenAPI schema | Written. See `openschema.md` Part 2. 7 endpoints: `getGPTState`, `injectEphemeral`, `createPersistentExperience`, `listExperiences`, `captureIdea`, `getLatestSynthesis`, `recordInteraction`. |
| 3 | GPT configuration | Create the Custom GPT on ChatGPT, paste instructions + schema, point at `https://mira.mytsapi.us`. |
| 4 | Verification | GPT calls `getGPTState` successfully. GPT creates an ephemeral experience that renders in the app. |

#### Phase 5B — Experience Quality Testing

Run 3 flows and score each on 5 criteria:

**Flow 1: Planning** — Take a vague idea → see if it becomes a real experience with shape.
- Looking for: compression, clarity, sequence, persistence

**Flow 2: Execution** — Use it to actually do something in the real world.
- Looking for: friction reduction, accountability, next-step quality, movement

**Flow 3: Re-entry** — Leave, do something, come back later.
- Looking for: memory continuity, state reconstruction, intelligent next move, aliveness

**5-point scorecard (per flow):**
1. Was it more useful than plain chat?
2. Did it create a real object or path?
3. Did it make me do something?
4. Did re-entry feel continuous?
5. Did it generate momentum?

#### Failure modes to watch for

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Chat with extra steps | Looks structured, but nothing really changed |
| Pretty persistence | Stuff is saved, but not meaningfully used |
| Question treadmill | Keeps asking good questions instead of creating action |
| Flat re-entry | Remembers facts, but not momentum |
| No bite | Helps, but never pushes |

#### Phase 5C — Quality Signal → Next Sprint Decision

Based on testing results:

| Signal | Next Move |
|--------|-----------|
| Structure ✅ State ✅ Behavior ✅ | Move to Sprint 6 (Chaining + Spontaneity) |
| Structure ✅ State ✅ Behavior ❌ | Focus sprint on: stronger escalation logic, better next-action generation, challenge/pressure mechanics, more assertive re-entry |
| Structure ✅ State ❌ | Fix synthesis/re-entry engine before moving forward |
| Structure ❌ | Fix renderer/step quality before anything else |

The coder gets involved when:
- GPT-authored experiences are proven useful
- Coder would create experiences that are genuinely impossible for GPT alone (complex branching, real-time data, multi-media, interactive simulations)
- The coder has enough context to participate (user profile, capability map, experience history)

### 🔲 Sprint 7 — Genkit Intelligence Layer (Backend Brain)

> **Goal:** Based on AI Coach analysis, embed intelligence *inside* the backend using Genkit to process data mutations into insight, decoupling deep analysis from the conversational GPT.

| # | Work Item | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Genkit Infrastructure | Install `genkit` and initialize Google AI plugin. Create `lib/ai/genkit.ts`. |
| 2 | Intelligent Synthesis Flow | Build `synthesizeExperienceFlow` (`gemini-2.5-flash`). Replace naive string summaries in `synthesis_snapshots` with AI-extracted narrative, actual signals, and next-step candidates running automatically at the end of an experience. |
| 3 | AI Profile Facet Extraction | Build `extractFacetsFlow`. Replace mechanical comma-split extraction `facet-service.ts` with semantic reading of user reflections to pull high-confidence interests and friction signatures. |
| 4 | Smart Next Suggestions | Build `suggestNextExperienceFlow`. Move beyond static progression chains to context-aware templated recommendations based on actual facet states. |

---

### ✅ Sprint 8 — Knowledge Tab + MiraK Integration (Complete)

> **Goal:** Give Mira a dedicated Knowledge surface where users study, practice, and track mastery — powered by MiraK research agents running on Cloud Run.
>
> **Results:** Implemented the "Option B" Webhook Handoff architecture. Built a 3-tab study workspace (Learn/Practice/Links), domain-organized grid, and home page "Continue Learning" dashboard. Integrated knowledge metadata into Genkit synthesis and suggestion flows. All 6 lanes verified.
>
### 🔲 Sprint 9 — Proposal → Realization → Coder Pipeline (Deferred)

> **Goal:** When results from Sprint 5 testing show that GPT-only experiences are too limited, bring the coder into the loop. Generated experiences go through a reviewable pipeline. Ephemeral experiences bypass entirely.
>
> **Prerequisite:** Sprint 5 testing proves the experience loop works but identifies specific gaps that only a coder can fill.
>
> **Key insight:** The GPT doesn't just "assign" work to the coder — it writes a living spec that IS the coder's instructions. The spec lives as a GitHub Issue. The frontend can also edit it. This makes the issue a contract between GPT, user, and coder.

| # | Work Item | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Proposal endpoint | `app/api/experiences/propose/route.ts` — GPT calls this with `{ experienceType, goal, resolution, reentry, sections, taskCount, whyNow }`. Creates a proposed experience instance (persistent). |
| 2 | Realization record | When coder picks up a proposal, a `realization` record is created linking `experience_instance_id` to GitHub PR (if applicable). |
| 3 | **Coder instruction issue** | GPT creates a GitHub Issue that serves as the coder's custom instructions. The issue body contains: experience schema, step payloads, resolution constraints, rendering requirements, and acceptance criteria. This is the coder's "prompt" — structured, not free-form. |
| 4 | **Issue-as-living-spec** | The frontend surfaces the instruction issue in the review UI. The user can edit it before the coder starts (add constraints, change resolution, tweak step content). GPT can also update it mid-flight if the user refines their request. The issue is a 3-way contract: GPT writes it, user refines it, coder executes it. |
| 5 | **Coder schema contract** | Define a structured schema for the issue body — not free-text markdown. Something parseable: YAML front-matter or a JSON code block that the coder agent can read programmatically. This is effectively a "coder OpenAPI" — the coder knows exactly what fields to read, what to build, and what to validate against. |
| 6 | Review UI evolution | Refactor `/review/[id]` to support both legacy PR reviews and new experience reviews. User-facing buttons: Preview Experience · Approve · Request Changes · Publish. |
| 7 | Publish flow | "Publish" = merge PR (if GitHub-backed) + set experience status to `published` + activate in workspace + fire re-entry contract registration. |
| 8 | Supersede/versioning | When a new version of an experience is published, old version moves to `superseded`. User sees latest in library. |
| 9 | Realization status tracking | `realization_reviews` table tracks: `drafted → ready_for_review → approved → published`. Maps to PR states internally. |
| 10 | Arena evolution | `/arena` shows both active realizations and active experiences. Two panes or unified view. |
| 11 | Coder context generation | Give the coder enough context to participate: user profile, capability map, experience history. See Sprint 9. |

#### Issue as state and memory (not just instructions)

> **Note:** We don't know the best shape for this yet. The core idea is that the GitHub Issue isn't just a one-shot spec — it's the coder's **working memory** during execution. The issue body starts as instructions, but the coder can update it as it works:
>
> - Append a "progress" section as steps are built
> - Log which renderers it created, which step payloads it validated
> - Flag blockers or questions for the user/GPT to answer
> - Mark acceptance criteria as met/unmet
>
> This turns the issue into a **live contract** — the coder writes to it, the GPT reads from it, the user can see what's happening in real-time.
>
> We may also be able to **trigger GitHub Actions workflows** or **dispatch events** to the coder when the user approves/modifies/requests changes. The webhook pipeline from Sprint 2 already supports `dispatch-workflow` — the question is how to wire it so the coder gets kicked off automatically when a spec is ready.
>
> The best implementation pattern is TBD. Could be: issue comments for progress, issue body for state, labels for status. Could be something else entirely. This will become clearer once Sprint 5 testing is done and we know what the coder actually needs to do.

#### DB-aware coder workflows

> **Key idea:** The coder doesn't have to work blind. Supabase secrets (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) are already stored in GitHub Actions environment secrets. This means a GitHub Actions workflow can query the live database during execution.
>
> This opens up a powerful pattern: **"based on what's in the database, do this."**
>
> Examples:
> - Coder reads the user's existing experiences from Supabase to understand what renderers and step types have already been used → avoids duplicating work, builds on existing patterns
> - Coder reads the spec issue + checks the `experience_templates` table to validate that the requested step types actually exist, and falls back or creates new ones if needed
> - Coder reads `interaction_events` to understand how users have engaged with similar experiences → tailors the new experience based on real usage data
> - Coder reads `synthesis_snapshots` to understand the user's current goals/direction → makes the experience feel personally relevant
> - On completion, coder writes the new experience instance + steps directly to Supabase (not just a PR with code) → the experience goes live without a deploy
>
> This makes the coder a **living participant** in the system, not just a code generator. It can read the DB, understand context, build something appropriate, and write results back — all within a single GitHub Actions run.
>
> **Infrastructure already in place:**
> - ✅ Supabase secrets in GitHub Actions env
> - ✅ `dispatch-workflow` endpoint exists (`/api/github/dispatch-workflow`)
> - ✅ Webhook handlers for `workflow_run` events exist (`lib/github/handlers/handle-workflow-run-event.ts`)
> - 🔲 Workflow YAML that actually uses the secrets to query Supabase
> - 🔲 Coder agent that knows how to read/write experience data

#### Why issue-as-instructions matters

1. **The coder never guesses.** Every experience spec is an explicit, parseable contract.
2. **The user has agency.** They can see and edit the spec before the coder starts.
3. **The GPT can iterate.** If the user says "actually make it harder," GPT updates the issue body.
4. **Traceability.** The issue history shows every change to the spec — who changed what and when.
5. **The coder can have its own "schema."** Just like the GPT has an OpenAPI schema for API calls, the coder can have a structured spec schema for what it reads from issues. Both are typed contracts.
6. **The issue is working memory.** The coder can write progress back to it. The GPT and user can read it. The issue becomes the shared context for the entire realization.

#### Sprint 6 Verification
- GPT can POST a proposal that creates both an experience instance AND a GitHub Issue with structured spec
- User can view and edit the coder spec from the frontend review UI
- GPT can update the issue body via API when the user refines their request
- Coder agent can parse the structured spec from the issue body
- Proposal can be approved and published via the UI
- Published experience appears in library and workspace with active re-entry contract
- Legacy PR merge flow still works
- Ephemeral experiences are confirmed to NOT appear in review queue

### 🔲 Sprint 10 — Chained Experiences + Spontaneity

> **Goal:** Make the app feel alive. Experiences chain, loop, interrupt, and progress the user forward.

| # | Work Item | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Experience graph wiring | Use `previous_experience_id` and `next_suggested_ids` on instances to build chains. Library shows "continue" and "related" links. |
| 2 | Progression rules | `lib/experience/progression-rules.ts` — defines chains: Questionnaire → Plan Builder → Challenge. Resolution carries forward or escalates. |
| 3 | Ephemeral injection system | GPT can inject ephemeral experiences at any time: trend alerts, micro-challenges, quick prompts. These appear as interruptive cards in the workspace or as toast-like prompts. |
| 4 | Re-entry engine hardening | `lib/experience/reentry-engine.ts` already exists. Harden: add time-based triggers, manual triggers, better inactivity detection. |
| 5 | Weekly loops | Recurring experience instances (e.g., weekly reflection). Same template, new instance, linked via graph. |
| 6 | Friction synthesis | Compute `friction_level` during synthesis snapshot creation. GPT uses this to adjust future proposals. |
| 7 | Follow-up prompts | After experience completion, re-entry contract surfaces in next GPT session as prioritized suggestion. |
| 8 | Timeline page | `app/timeline/page.tsx` — chronological view of GPT proposals, realizations, completions, ephemerals, suggestions. |
| 9 | Profile page | `app/profile/page.tsx` — compiled view of interests, goals, efforts, patterns, skill trajectory. Read-only, derived from facets. |

#### Sprint 7 Verification
- Completing a Questionnaire surfaces a Plan Builder suggestion via graph
- GPT can inject an ephemeral challenge that renders instantly
- Re-entry contract fires after completion and shows in GPT state
- Weekly reflection creates a new linked instance
- Timeline shows full event history including ephemerals
- Profile reflects accumulated facets from interactions
- Friction level is computed and returned in synthesis packet

### 🔲 Sprint 11 — GitHub Hardening + GitHub App

> **Goal:** Make the realization side production-serious. Migrate from PAT to GitHub App for proper auth.

| # | Work Item | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Typed realization workflows | GitHub Actions for: validate experience schema, deploy preview, sync realization status. |
| 2 | Schema checks | CI check that validates `config_schema` against step renderer contract. |
| 3 | PR comment summaries | Auto-comment on PRs with experience summary + resolution profile + preview link. |
| 4 | Selective issue creation | Issues only for large realizations. Small experiences skip issues entirely. Ephemeral never touches GitHub. |
| 5 | **GitHub App implementation** | Replace PAT with a proper GitHub App. Per-installation trust model. This is required for production — PAT auth doesn't scale and is a security liability. The App gets its own permissions scope (issues, PRs, webhooks, Actions dispatch) and can be installed on specific repos. `lib/github/client.ts` is already designed as the auth boundary — only that file changes. |
| 6 | **Webhook migration** | Currently using Cloudflare tunnel + raw HMAC webhook. In production, the webhook receiver needs to handle GitHub App webhook format. The signature verification in `lib/github/signature.ts` may need updates for App-style payloads. |

---

### 🔲 Sprint 12 — Personalization + Coder Knowledge

> **Goal:** Vectorize the user through action history and give the coder compiled intelligence.

| # | Work Item | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Compressed snapshots | Automated synthesis snapshot generation after each experience completion. |
| 2 | Facet extraction | Extract `profile_facets` from interaction patterns (interests, skills, effort areas, preferred resolution profiles). |
| 3 | Preference drift tracking | Compare facets over time to detect shifting interests/goals. |
| 4 | Experience recommendation layer | Rule-based recommendation: given current facets + completion history + friction signals, suggest next experiences. |
| 5 | GPT context budget | Compress synthesis packets to fit within GPT context limits while preserving maximum signal. |
| 6 | Coder-context generation | `lib/services/coder-context-service.ts` — generates `docs/coder-context/*.md` from DB state. Only now, when there's real data to compile from. |
| 7 | Capability map | `docs/coder-context/capability-map.md` — what renderers exist, what step types are supported, what endpoints are available. |

---

### 🔲 Sprint 13 — Production Deployment

> **Goal:** Deploy Mira Studio to Vercel for real use. Replace the local dev tunnel with production infrastructure. This is where the webhook, auth, and edge function questions get answered.
>
> **Reality check:** Right now everything runs on `localhost:3000` with a Cloudflare tunnel (`mira.mytsapi.us`). That works for dev and GPT testing, but for real use we need:
> - The app hosted somewhere permanent (Vercel)
> - Webhooks that don't depend on a local machine being on
> - Auth that isn't a hardcoded user ID
> - The GPT pointing at a real URL, not a tunnel

| # | Work Item | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Vercel deployment** | Deploy Next.js app to Vercel. Environment variables for Supabase, GitHub token/app credentials. Vercel project setup, domain config. |
| 2 | **GPT server URL update** | Update the OpenAPI schema `servers` URL from `https://mira.mytsapi.us` to the production Vercel URL. Re-configure the Custom GPT. |
| 3 | **Webhook endpoint hardening** | `/api/webhook/github` currently expects to receive events via tunnel. In production it receives events directly from GitHub. May need to update signature verification, handle GitHub App webhook format. The existing `app/api/webhook/vercel/route.ts` stub needs to be implemented if Vercel deploy hooks are needed. |
| 4 | **Edge function evaluation** | Determine if any API routes need to run as Vercel Edge Functions or Supabase Edge Functions. Candidates: `/api/gpt/state` (latency-sensitive, called at every GPT conversation start), `/api/experiences/inject` (needs to be fast for ephemeral experiences), `/api/interactions` (high-volume telemetry). Trade-off: edge functions have limitations (no Node.js APIs, different runtime) vs. serverless functions (slower cold starts). |
| 5 | **Supabase Edge Functions** | If the coder pipeline needs server-side orchestration that can't run in Vercel serverless (long-running, needs to call GitHub API + Supabase in sequence), a Supabase Edge Function may be the right place. Use case: "on experience approval, dispatch coder workflow, create realization record, update issue status" — that's a multi-step side effect that shouldn't block the UI. |
| 6 | **Auth system** | Replace `DEFAULT_USER_ID` with real auth. Options: Supabase Auth (email/magic link), or just a simple API key for the GPT. The GPT needs to authenticate somehow — either a shared secret header or OAuth. |
| 7 | **Environment parity** | Ensure local dev still works after production deploy. The Cloudflare tunnel setup should remain for local GPT testing. `.env.local` vs `.env.production` split. |
| 8 | **GitHub App webhook registration** | If Sprint 8 migrated to a GitHub App, the App's webhook URL needs to point at the Vercel production URL, not the tunnel. This is a one-time config change in the GitHub App settings. |

#### Key decisions to make before Sprint 10

| Question | Options | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Edge functions: Vercel or Supabase? | Vercel Edge (fast, limited runtime) vs Supabase Edge (Deno, can be longer-running) vs plain serverless (slower, full Node.js) | Affects which routes can run where |
| GPT auth in production? | Shared secret header, OAuth, or Supabase Auth token | Affects OpenAPI schema `security` section |
| Can the coder run as a GitHub Action triggered by webhook? | Yes (dispatch workflow on approval) vs external agent polling issues | Affects Sprint 6 + 8 architecture |
| Custom domain? | `mira.mytsapi.us` via Vercel, or new domain | Affects GPT config + webhook registration |

#### Sprint 10 Verification
- App is live on Vercel at a permanent URL
- GPT Actions point at production URL and all 10 endpoints work
- GitHub webhooks deliver to production without tunnel dependency
- Local dev mode still works with tunnel for testing
- No hardcoded `DEFAULT_USER_ID` in production paths

## Refactoring Rules

These rules govern how we evolve the existing codebase without breaking it.

1. **Additive, not destructive.** New entities and routes are added alongside existing ones. Nothing gets deleted until it's fully replaced.
2. **Storage adapter pattern.** `lib/storage.ts` gets an adapter interface. JSON file adapter stays as fallback. Supabase adapter becomes primary.
3. **Service layer stays.** All 11 existing services keep working. New services are added for experience, interaction, synthesis.
4. **State machine extends.** `lib/state-machine.ts` gains `EXPERIENCE_TRANSITIONS` alongside existing `IDEA_TRANSITIONS`, `PROJECT_TRANSITIONS`, `PR_TRANSITIONS`.
5. **Types extend.** New files in `types/` for experiences, interactions, synthesis. Existing types gain optional new fields (e.g., `Project.experienceInstanceId`).
6. **Routes extend.** New routes under `app/api/experiences/`, `app/api/interactions/`, `app/api/synthesis/`. Existing routes untouched.
7. **Copy evolves.** `studio-copy.ts` gains experience-language sections. Existing copy preserved.
8. **GitHub stays as realization substrate.** No runtime data goes to GitHub. DB is the runtime memory.
9. **GPT contract expands.** New endpoints for proposals, ephemeral injection, and state fetch. Existing `idea_captured` webhook preserved.
10. **No model logic in frontend.** Components render from typed schemas. The backend decides what to show.
11. **Resolution is explicit, not inferred.** Every experience carries a resolution object that governs depth, mode, time scope, and intensity. No guessing.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do Instead |
|----------|--------------|
| Make GitHub the app database | Use Supabase for runtime, GitHub for realizations |
| Expose "Merge PR" as user-facing language | Use "Approve Experience" / "Publish" |
| Hand-maintain `.md` files as source of truth | Generate coder-context docs from DB (Sprint 8+) |
| Build infinite experience types at once | Ship 6 Tier 1 classes, then iterate |
| Put model logic in React components | Compute in services, render from schema |
| Replace the whole app | Extend the current structure additively |
| Force every experience through GitHub Issues | Issues only for large realizations needing decomposition |
| Make everything pipeline-like | Add ephemeral experiences for spontaneity |
| Let the coder guess resolution | Make resolution an explicit typed object on every instance |
| Interpret friction in-app | Compute friction during synthesis, let GPT interpret |
| Over-invest in coder-context early | Prioritize experience system → renderer → DB → re-entry first |
| Call internal objects "builds" | Use "realizations" — we're realizing experiences, not building features |

## Sprint 5B — Experience Robustness (Field Test Findings)

> **Source:** Live user testing of the "AI Operator Brand" persistent experience — 18 steps, `heavy/build/multi_day/high` resolution. This is the first real field test of a GPT-authored multi-day experience and it exposed hard failures in every renderer.

### What Happened

The GPT created an ambitious, well-structured 18-step experience (questionnaire → reflection → lessons → plan builders → challenges → essay). The *content design* is strong — the steps build on each other, the progression makes sense, and the scope is appropriate for a multi-day build-mode experience.

But the *renderer infrastructure* broke down at every interaction point. The user hit wall after wall:

### 5 Hard Failures

| # | Failure | Where | Root Cause |
|---|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **Lesson checkpoints have no input field** | Steps 2, 6 ("Write 3 sentences…", "Describe in one paragraph…") | `LessonStep` renders `checkpoint` sections as a single "I Understand" button. The GPT wrote a checkpoint that asks the user to *write* something, but the renderer only supports *acknowledging*. There is no text area, no space to put the sentences. The user sees a writing prompt with nowhere to write. |
| 2 | **EssayTasks step has no essay writing area** | Step 17 ("Write the brand manifesto in one page") | `EssayTasksStep` renders `tasks` as boolean checkboxes and the `content` field as a collapsible read-only block. There is no text area to actually *write* the manifesto. The tasks just toggle true/false. The whole point of the step — deep writing — is impossible. |
| 3 | **Plan Builder items are trivial checkboxes** | Steps 3, 8, 11, 16 | `PlanBuilderStep` renders each item as a checkbox with hover-to-reorder. Items like "Define funnel stages" and "Define pricing and packaging" are serious multi-hour activities that deserve their own workspace — not a checkbox you click to acknowledge. You can't expand, add notes, or come back. |
| 4 | **Challenge "Market Scan" is impossibly scoped for a single page** | Step 4 ("Study 30 real small businesses") | `ChallengeStep` gives each objective a 2-row textarea labeled "Record your progress or results…". Studying 30 businesses and capturing patterns is a multi-session research activity. It needs its own workspace, a structured capture surface, and the ability to come back over days. Instead it's a single screen you pass through. |
| 5 | **The entire experience is a forced linear slide deck** | All 18 steps | `ExperienceRenderer` tracks `currentStepIndex` and only moves forward. No step navigation, no ability to go back, no way to see what's ahead. An 18-step multi-day experience renders as page 1 → page 2 → … → page 18. You can't revisit a reflection you wrote last week. You can't check your plan while doing a challenge. The system loses all the user's context because it behaves like a wizard, not a workspace. |

### What This Means for the Architecture

These aren't renderer polish issues — they reveal a fundamental mismatch between what the GPT can *author* and what the renderers can *support*. The GPT authored a legitimate multi-week learning and building curriculum. The renderers treated it like a form wizard.

The core insight: **experiences aren't linear slides. They're workspaces you inhabit over time.** The current architecture forces every experience through a single narrow pipe (`currentStepIndex++`). Multi-day, heavy, high-intensity experiences need a fundamentally different interaction model.

### 10 Robustness Upgrades

These are ordered by impact on the user experience and structured to reference existing roadmap items and coach.md flows where applicable.

---

#### R1: Non-Linear Step Navigation (Experience as Workspace)

**Problem:** The renderer is a forward-only wizard. Multi-day experiences need free navigation.

**Solution:** Replace the linear `currentStepIndex` model with a step-map navigator. The user should see a persistent side-nav or top-nav showing all steps with completion status. They can jump to any step, revisit completed steps (read-only or re-editable based on type), and see what's ahead.

**Key design rules:**
- Steps can have `blocked` / `available` / `active` / `completed` states.
- Some steps can be gated (e.g., "complete questionnaire before challenge"), but most should be freely navigable.
- The experience becomes a *place you go into*, not a tunnel you pass through.
- Resolution still controls chrome: `light` = minimal nav, `heavy` = full node map.

**Connects to:** Roadmap Sprint 8 "Experience graph wiring" (internal chaining). R1 is the *intra-experience* version of that problem.

---

#### R2: Checkpoint Sections Must Support Text Input

**Problem:** `LessonStep` checkpoints render as "I Understand" buttons even when the content asks the user to write something.

**Solution:** Add a `checkpoint` sub-type or detect prompts that ask for writing. When a checkpoint body contains a writing prompt (or is explicitly tagged), render a textarea + submit instead of a confirmation button. Capture the response as an interaction event.

**Two modes:**
- `confirm` checkpoint → "I Understand" button (current behavior, appropriate for knowledge checks)
- `respond` checkpoint → textarea + word count + submit (for "Write 3 sentences explaining…")

This is a renderer change — the `checkpoint` section type in the lesson payload gets an optional `mode: 'confirm' | 'respond'` field. The GPT can also be instructed to use the right mode.

---

#### R3: EssayTasks Must Have a Writing Surface

**Problem:** The essay step has no writing area. Tasks are boolean checkboxes for work that requires deep composition.

**Solution:** `EssayTasksStep` needs two surfaces:
1. **Reading pane** — the `content` field (the brief/instructions), always visible (not collapsed).
2. **Writing pane** — a rich textarea per task where the user actually *writes*. Each task becomes a titled section with a textarea, word count, and auto-save.

The task checkboxes can remain as a secondary signal, but the primary interaction is *writing*, not *checking*.

**Connects to:** coach.md flow #2 (In-App Coaching Chat). A coaching co-pilot embedded alongside the writing pane would make this dramatically more useful — "Am I on the right track with this manifesto section?"

---

#### R4: Challenge Steps Need Expandable Workspaces

**Problem:** Complex challenges like "Study 30 businesses" render as a flat list with tiny textareas.

**Solution:** Each challenge objective should expand into its own mini-workspace when clicked. The collapsed view shows the objective + completion status. The expanded view shows:
- The full description + proof requirements
- A resizable textarea (or eventually a structured form)
- Draft save indicator
- Ability to attach notes, links, or artifacts

For research-intensive objectives, a further evolution: embed structured capture (rows of data, tags, notes per entry). This is where Genkit flows from coach.md become natural — an AI that helps you *do the research*, not just track whether you did it.

**Connects to:** coach.md flow #3 (Experience Content Generation). The challenge workspace can include AI-assisted research helpers, content scaffolding, or example analysis powered by Genkit — making the challenge step a *tool for doing the work*, not just a checklist of whether you did it.

#### R5: Plan Builder Items Must Support Notes and Detail

**Problem:** Plan items like "Define funnel stages" are checkbox-only. No space to add work.

**Solution:** Plan Builder items become expandable cards. Click to expand → shows a notes area, sub-items, and links. The checkbox acknowledges the item; the expanded card is where the real work happens.

**Future state:** Plan items can become their own mini-experiences. "Define funnel stages" could open a sub-experience with its own steps. This is the "fractalization" concept — experiences contain experiences.

**Connects to:** Roadmap Sprint 8 "Experience graph wiring" + "Progression rules" — the plan builder becomes a graph node, not a flat list.

#### R6: Multi-Pass GPT Enrichment (Iterative Experience Construction)

**Problem:** The GPT creates the entire experience in one shot. An 18-step curriculum is too much to get right on the first pass — the GPT can't know what depth each section needs until the user starts working.

**Solution:** Allow the GPT to make 3-4 passes over an experience:

**Pass 1 — Outline:** GPT creates the experience with structural steps (titles, types, high-level goals). Payloads are intentionally sparse — "skeleton" content.

**Pass 2 — Enrichment:** After the user starts (or based on questionnaire answers), the GPT re-enters and fills out the step payloads with personalized, detailed content. This uses the re-entry contract + the `suggestNextExperienceFlow` from coach.md.

**Pass 3 — Adaptation:** After the user completes early steps (or expresses friction), the GPT updates remaining steps. Lessons become more specific. Challenges scale to the user's demonstrated level. New steps can be inserted.

**Pass 4+ — Deepening:** Completed steps can be "deepened" — the GPT adds follow-up content, harder challenges, or new sections to a lesson the user engaged with deeply.

**Technical requirements:**
- An API endpoint to update individual `experience_steps` payloads on an existing instance
- Step insertion (add new steps between existing ones)
- Step removal or soft-disable (if later context makes a step irrelevant)
- Re-entry contract triggers at specific step completions, not just experience completion

**Connects to:** coach.md flow #3 (Experience Content Generation), #7 (Experience Quality Scoring), #8 (Intelligent Re-Entry Prompts). This is the mechanism that makes multi-day experiences *alive* rather than *stale*.

#### R7: Research/Skill-Based Step Type (Rich Activity Page)

**Problem:** "Study 30 businesses" is crammed into a ChallengeStep — but it's fundamentally a different kind of activity. It's not a task to complete; it's a *skill to develop* through repeated practice sessions.

**Solution:** A new step type (Tier 2): `research` or `skill_lab`. This renders as its own workspace page with:
- A structured entry pad (rows/cards for each research subject)
- AI-assisted research tools (Genkit flow that can scan a URL, summarize a business, extract patterns)
- Pattern aggregation (the system shows emerging themes across your entries)
- Multi-session support (you come back and add more entries over days)
- Progress visualization (30 entries goal → currently at 12)

This is the first step type that truly benefits from Genkit intelligence — the AI doesn't just passively record, it actively participates in the research.

**Connects to:** coach.md flow #3 (Content Generation) + #5 (Profile Facet Extraction). The research data the user generates becomes input for facet extraction and next-experience suggestion.

**Architectural note:** This step type may need its own page route (`/workspace/[instanceId]/research/[stepId]`) rather than rendering inline, because it's too rich for the current single-pane layout.

---

#### R8: Step-Level Re-Entry Instead of Experience-Level Only

**Problem:** Re-entry contracts currently fire at experience completion. But multi-day experiences need re-entry *during* the experience — at specific step boundaries.

**Solution:** Allow `reentry` hooks on individual steps, not just on the experience instance:
- After completing the questionnaire → GPT enriches upcoming steps based on answers
- After the market scan → GPT generates a synthesis of patterns found
- After writing a draft → GPT provides feedback on the writing

This turns the linear experience into a *conversation with the system*. The user does work, the system responds with intelligence, the user continues with more context.

**Connects to:** coach.md flow #2 (In-App Coaching Chat), #6 (Friction Analysis), #8 (Intelligent Re-Entry Prompts). Step-level re-entry is what makes the "coach" concept real — not a separate chat panel, but the system naturally responding to your progress at natural breakpoints.

---

#### R9: Experience Overview / Progress Dashboard

**Problem:** With 18 steps, the user has no map. They don't know where they are, what's ahead, or what they've accomplished.

**Solution:** An experience overview page that shows:
- All steps in a visual layout (node map, timeline, or structured list)
- Completion status per step (with time spent, drafts saved, word counts)
- Blocked/available gates
- Quick-jump navigation
- A summary of submitted work (your questionnaire answers, your reflections, your challenge results)
- Re-entry suggestions ("Mira thinks you should focus on Step 9 next")

This overview is the "home" of the experience. You land here, orient yourself, then dive into a specific step. It replaces the current "start at page 1 and click forward" model.

**Connects to:** Roadmap "Frontend Surface Map" — this is the evolution of `/workspace/[instanceId]` from a single-pane renderer into a proper workspace.

---

#### R10: Draft Persistence and Work Recoverability

**Problem:** The telemetry system captures `draft_saved` events with content, but these are fire-and-forget interaction events — they don't hydrate back into the renderer on return. If you reload the page or come back tomorrow, all your in-progress text is gone.

**Solution:**
- Step renderers should persist work-in-progress to a durable store (Supabase `artifacts` table or a `step_drafts` column on `experience_steps`)
- When the user revisits a step, their previous drafts are hydrated back
- Challenge textareas, reflection responses, essay writing — all auto-saved and recoverable
- Visual indicator showing "Last saved 3m ago" or "Draft from March 25"

**This is critical for multi-day experiences.** Without it, the system tells you to "study 30 businesses" but forgets everything you wrote if you close the tab.

**Connects to:** The `artifacts` table already exists in the schema. The `useInteractionCapture` hook already fires `draft_saved` events. The missing link is *reading them back* and hydrating the renderer state from saved drafts.

### Priority Ordering

| Priority | Upgrade | Why First | Sprint |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 🔴 P0 | R1 (Non-linear navigation) | Without this, multi-day experiences are unusable. Everything depends on being able to navigate freely. | 5B |
| 🔴 P0 | R10 (Draft persistence) | Without this, any multi-session work is lost. The system is lying about being "multi-day" if it can't remember your work. | 5B |
| 🔴 P0 | R2 (Checkpoint text input) | Easy fix, huge impact. Lessons become interactive instead of passive. | 5B |
| 🔴 P0 | R3 (Essay writing surface) | The essay step is broken — its core function (writing) is impossible. | 5B |
| 🟠 P1 | R4 (Expandable challenge workspaces) | Makes challenges feel like real work surfaces, not flat lists. | 5B/6 |
| 🟠 P1 | R5 (Plan notes/expansion) | Makes plan builders useful, not trivial. | 5B/6 |
| 🟠 P1 | R9 (Experience overview dashboard) | The map that makes navigation meaningful. Can be built alongside R1. | 5B/6 |
| 🟡 P2 | R6 (Multi-pass GPT enrichment) | Requires API changes + GPT instruction updates. Higher complexity, massive payoff. | 6 |
| 🟡 P2 | R8 (Step-level re-entry) | Natural extension of the re-entry engine. Requires Genkit flows to be useful. | 6/7 |
| 🟢 P3 | R7 (Research/skill-lab step type) | New step type, highest complexity. Benefits from R4 + R6 being done first. | 7+ |

### How This Changed the Sprint Plan

Sprint 5B became a **renderer hardening sprint** before moving to Genkit (now Sprint 7). Without R1, R2, R3, and R10, the Genkit flows would have been adding intelligence to a system that couldn't even let users *work* inside their experiences. The renderers became workspaces first, then AI can make those workspaces intelligent.

The executed sequence:
1. **Sprint 5B** ✅ — Contracts + graph + timeline + profile + validators + progression (groundwork)
2. **Sprint 6** ✅ — R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5 + R6 + R9 + R10 (full workspace model, navigation, drafts, multi-pass API)
3. **Sprint 7** 🔲 — Genkit flows (synthesis, facets, suggestions) — the workspaces are now ready for intelligence
4. **Sprint 8+** 🔲 — R7 (research step type) + R8 (step-level re-entry) + coder pipeline

### Lesson for the GPT

The GPT authored a genuinely excellent curriculum. The *content design* beat the *infrastructure*. This is a positive signal — the GPT understands depth, sequencing, and skill-building better than the app could initially render.

**Current GPT capabilities (post-Sprint 6):**
- ✅ Create 18+ step experiences — workspace navigator handles any number of steps
- ✅ Use `checkpoint` type with writing prompts — textareas render for `respond` mode
- ✅ Use `essay_tasks` for long-form writing — per-task textareas with word counts
- ✅ Use multi-pass enrichment — update/add/remove/reorder steps after initial creation
- ✅ Drafts persist — users can close the browser and return tomorrow
- ✅ Schedule steps — set `scheduled_date`, `due_date`, `estimated_minutes` for pacing

- [ ] Which Supabase org / project to use? (Edgefire, Threadslayer, or Workmanwise — or create new?)
- [ ] Auth strategy: Supabase Auth (email/magic link) or stay single-user with service role key?
- [ ] Should the JSON fallback persist permanently for offline dev, or sunset after DB migration?
- [ ] How does the DSL for experience specs evolve — YAML in issue body, or structured JSON via API?
- [ ] Should the coder spec schema live in the issue body (YAML front-matter), a separate `.coder-spec.yml` file in the PR, or a dedicated Supabase table? Trade-off: issue body is visible + editable by all 3 parties (GPT, user, coder), but file-in-repo is version-controlled.
- [ ] Should the frontend have a spec editor UI, or is editing the issue body directly sufficient?
- [ ] What's the right compression strategy for GPT re-entry packets? (token budget vs. signal)
- [ ] Should Tier 1 experience templates be hardcoded or editable via admin UI?
- [ ] Should ephemeral experiences have a separate library section ("Moments") or inline with persistent?
- [ ] How does the coder agent get triggered? GitHub Actions workflow dispatch on approval, or external agent polling for issues with a specific label? Or GitHub Copilot coding agent assignment?
- [ ] Should the issue serve as working memory (coder writes progress back to issue body/comments) or should state live in Supabase with the issue as a read-only spec?
- [ ] Vercel Edge Functions vs Supabase Edge Functions vs plain serverless — which routes need edge performance?
- [ ] What auth does the GPT use in production? Shared secret, OAuth, or Supabase Auth token in the header?
- [ ] If the coder can write directly to Supabase, does the experience even need a PR/deploy? Or can the coder create experience_instances + steps directly in the DB and they go live immediately? (Code changes still need PRs, but pure data experiences might not.)

## Principles

1. **Experience is the central noun.** Not PR, not Issue, not Project.
2. **DB for runtime, GitHub for realization.** Two parallel truths, never confused.
3. **Approve Experience, not Merge PR.** User-facing language is always non-technical.
4. **Resolution is explicit.** Every experience carries a typed resolution object. No guessing, no drifting.
5. **Spontaneity lives next to structure.** Ephemeral experiences make the system feel alive. Persistent experiences make it feel intentional.
6. **Every experience creates its own continuation.** Re-entry contracts ensure GPT re-enters with targeted awareness, not generic memory.
7. **Additive evolution, not rewrites.** Extend what works. Replace nothing until it's fully superseded.
8. **The app stays dumb and clean.** Intelligence lives in GPT and the coder. The app renders and records.
9. **Friction is observed, not acted on.** The app computes friction. GPT interprets it. The app never reacts to its own friction signal.
10. **Sometimes explain. Sometimes immerse.** The resolution object decides. The system never defaults to one mode.
